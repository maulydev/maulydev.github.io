|Full-Stack Web Developer |

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a full-stack web developer passionate about creating web applications. This portfolio showcases some of the projects I've worked on and provides information about my skills and experience.


## About Me

Hi, I'm Mawuli, a passionate full-stack web developer with a love for creating web applications. My journey in web development began with a strong curiosity for building things and a desire to bring creative ideas to life. Over the years, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, and I thrive on the challenges and endless learning opportunities that this field offers.

My goal is to create web solutions that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience. I enjoy collaborating with teams, tackling complex problems, and turning innovative ideas into functional, user-friendly applications. The ever-evolving nature of web technologies keeps me excited and motivated to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.

In my free time, you can find me exploring new coding frameworks, or building personal side projects. I'm a strong believer in the open-source community and the power of collaboration.
